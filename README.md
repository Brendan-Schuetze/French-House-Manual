# French House Manual
## Fall 2018

---

#### LAST UPDATE: 11-19-2018
*The French House manual is made to be a set of guidelines - the cooperative living experience is a fluid one which changes from semester to semester. The manual is not the end all be all for house rules - inclusion in the manual doens't mean the house's stance is rigid on a particular topic, while exclusion from the manula doesn't give license to commit any other action.*

### THE SEVEN CO-OPERATIVE PRINCIPLES

#### VOLUNTARY AND OPEN MEMBERSHIP
Co-operatives are voluntary organizations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.

#### DEMOCRATIC MEMBER CONTROL
Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner.

#### MEMBER ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION
Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribesd as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.

#### AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE
Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.

#### EDUCATION, TRAINING AND INFORMATION
Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their cooperatives. They inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.

#### CO-OPERATION AMONG CO-OPERATIVES
Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.

#### CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY
Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.

### BASIC HOUSE GUIDELINES

#### Membership/House Process
Membership is available to any upper division college student or graduate student. Accpetance to French House is guaranteed to all other applicants granted that there are no upper division or graduate level students on the waitlist, a room is available, and they meet all requirements given to you by ICC. Non-students will be accepted only if no students remain on the waitlist.

The house process requires that prospective members attend a mandatory house tour before moving into French House. A tour via skype call is also acceptable if they are not in Austin. If they meet all other membership and ICC requirements, they can then apply to move in.

House members my raise objections about a prospective member directly to the trustee or appropriate ICC staff member at any point before the contract is signed. The ICC office will discern whether these objections my be the basis for rejecting a prospective members's application to French House.

#### Member Orientation
All members must be present for Member Orientation, run by the Trustee and Labor Czar, directly following the first meeting of each semester. This orientation will include a quick overview of major rules, a hands-on tour of the kitchen (Jackson rules, cast iron cleaning, where things go/are,) save plate policy, etc.

This is optional for members who have lived at French House for 3 semester or more.

If no new members move in over the interim periods, the orientation is optional at the discretion of Labor Czar and Trustee. If new members move in during the semester, whether they need a Member Orientation is at the discretion of Labor Czar and Trustee.

#### House Meetings
Mandatory meetings occur every other Sunday after dinner, and all French House members are required to attend. The date of a meeting may be changed by informal or formal house vote but must be done 48 hours in advance. Showing up late to meetings, leaving early, or leaving for extended periods (greater than 10 minutes) will result in your being marked absent.

Unexcused absences
Officers: Maximum of one unexcused absence before $5 fine.
        Three unexcused absences will result in member review.
Members: Maximum of two unexcused absences before $5 fine.
        Four unexcused absences will result in member review.

Meetings must maintain quorum (defined by greater than 50% of the house) in order to make house decisions. Assuming quorum is met, a vote may pass only if the vote is a true majority (5 votes for, 5 abstaining would be a failed vote.)
