# French House Manual
## Fall 2018

---

#### LAST UPDATE: 11-19-2018
*The French House manual is made to be a set of guidelines - the cooperative living experience is a fluid one which changes from semester to semester. The manual is not the end all be all for house rules - inclusion in the manual doens't mean the house's stance is rigid on a particular topic, while exclusion from the manual doesn't give license to commit any other action.*

### THE SEVEN CO-OPERATIVE PRINCIPLES

#### VOLUNTARY AND OPEN MEMBERSHIP
Co-operatives are voluntary organizations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.

#### DEMOCRATIC MEMBER CONTROL
Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner.

#### MEMBER ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION
Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribesd as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.

#### AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE
Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.

#### EDUCATION, TRAINING AND INFORMATION
Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their cooperatives. They inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.

#### CO-OPERATION AMONG CO-OPERATIVES
Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.

#### CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY
Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.

#### REVISION HISTORY

### BASIC HOUSE GUIDELINES

#### Membership/House Process
Membership is available to any upper division college student or graduate student. Accpetance to French House is guaranteed to all other applicants granted that there are no upper division or graduate level students on the waitlist, a room is available, and they meet all requirements given to you by ICC. Non-students will be accepted only if no students remain on the waitlist.

The house process requires that prospective members attend a mandatory house tour before moving into French House. A tour via skype call is also acceptable if they are not in Austin. If they meet all other membership and ICC requirements, they can then apply to move in.

House members my raise objections about a prospective member directly to the trustee or appropriate ICC staff member at any point before the contract is signed. The ICC office will discern whether these objections my be the basis for rejecting a prospective members's application to French House.  
*See also, Interim: House Process*

#### Member Orientation
All members must be present for Member Orientation, run by the Trustee and Labor Czar, directly following the first meeting of each semester. This orientation will include a quick overview of major rules, a hands-on tour of the kitchen (Jackson rules, cast iron cleaning, where things go/are,) save plate policy, etc.

This is optional for members who have lived at French House for 3 semester or more.

If no new members move in over the interim periods, the orientation is optional at the discretion of Labor Czar and Trustee. If new members move in during the semester, whether they need a Member Orientation is at the discretion of Labor Czar and Trustee.

#### House Meetings
Mandatory meetings occur every other Sunday after dinner, and all French House members are required to attend. The date of a meeting may be changed by informal or formal house vote but must be done 48 hours in advance. Showing up late to meetings, leaving early, or leaving for extended periods (greater than 10 minutes) will result in your being marked absent.

Unexcused absences  
Officers: Maximum of one unexcused absence before $5 fine.  
        Three unexcused absences will result in member review.  
Members: Maximum of two unexcused absences before $5 fine.  
        Four unexcused absences will result in member review.  

Meetings must maintain quorum (defined by greater than 50% of the house) in order to make house decisions. Assuming quorum is met, a vote may pass only if the vote is a true majority (5 votes for, 5 abstaining would be a failed vote.)

---

If you cannot attend a meeting you must notify the Trustee 24 hours in advance. If you miss a meeting, you are expected to read the minutes and will be held accountable for any decisions made at meetings, regardless of attendance.

The General Membership Meeting (GMM), counts as a mandatory house meeting and being absent without notifying the Trustee with a reasonable excuse will count as an absence.

Proposals, which are changes to the house manual, or an allocation of house funds, must be submitted to the Trustee 48 hours or more before a meeting. The trustee will post and/or email a meeting agenda every Friday preceding a meeting by midnight. House members can bring forward one spontaneous proposal which was not submitted to the Trustee each semester, which must be voted in by a 2/3 house vote.

A spontaneous proposal, regardless of whether it passes or fails, may only be introduced once per member, per semester.

#### Abstention Voting
"Abstention" votes are removed from the voting pool and per Robert's Rules of Order. Abstentions are counted and noted, but not as a "yes" or "no" vote. An abstention does not affect the voting result. A member has a right to abstain and cannot be compelled to vote. A member has an obligation to abstain if he or she has a direct personal interest in the matter that amounts to a legal conflict of interest. The total of "yes" and "no" votes must meet quorum for a vote to pass, otherwise it fails by abstention. If quorum os met and there are more "yes" votes than "no" votes, the motion passes.

#### Smoking
Common areas and personal areas are smoke free. Smoking is allowed outside only. if the member living in room #1 has a problem with smoke, they may bring it up at a meeting and it will be prohibited until the member moves out, changes rooms, or decides to re-allow it.

#### Parking
Only French House members may park in the lot or driveway. Guests may not park there. If you need to momentarily pull into the driveway, you must be available to move your car. Double parking is not acceptable.

#### Common Interests
1. No animals allowed.
2. Television use in common areas is outlawed, excepting for special events such as a house movie night. (if a member's TV is used for such an event it must be removed from commons by evening)
3. Entering a housemate's room without permission is considered a violation of privacy and such acts may warrant a Member Review.
4. No singing, live, or loud music after 10PM Sundays through Thursdays. Members should lower music when asked by a housemate, regardless of time of day.
5. Members must be courteous and abide by French House and ICC policies.
6. Members must help with house security by locking windows and doors when nobody is in the common areas, as well as turning off lights when leaving a room.
7. Not knowing a rule does not make a housemate exempt from said rule.

#### Roof Access
Being of the roof for any reason is an act punishable by a fine of $50.00 and/or eviction (ICC Standing Rule.)

#### Cup Runs
A house officer may call a Cup Run by writing a note on the whiteboard 24 hours in advance. Two volunteers, one of which must be an officer, will go from room to room collecting house dishes. If the occupant is not home, the room may be opened with the extra key (failure by the officers to gain access to the key box will result in the member getting a free pass should their door be locked.) Additionally, if someone does not want their room accessed, they may leave their dishes outside their room with a note, and their room will be left alone.

The room with the most points must wash all the Cup Run dishes - 1/2 point will be awarded for every utensil, 1 full point for all other dishes.

#### Commons and Bikes
Members should remove all personal items from common spaces every day. A personal mess fine can be given by an officer to anyone leaving personal items or dishes in the commons for over 24 hours. Items left in the kitchen for 5 hours or more are also applicable for a personal mess fine.

Bikes are not allowed in the commons for any extended amount of time. If you need to leave your bike in the commons for 5 minutes or less, that is acceptable, however any additional time can result in a $5.00 fine.

#### House Parties
A proposal should be made for house parties of any kind and presented at a House Meeting. Majority vote is required for the party to be allowed. If any proposed party is for a group/organization/cause that is not directly related to French House, the proposer will be responsible for party cleanup.

When a party is proposed 7 labor positions must be filled, including post-party commons and grounds cleans. If you do not do your labor by 5PM the day following a party, you will be assessed with a warning or violation.

Any member which attends a house party must sign up for Party Labor.  
*See also, Labor: Party Labor.*

---

#### Roommate Contracts
Roommate contracts serve as official agreements between roommates regarding the rules and expectations for a room. The content of a contract is at discretion of the roommates themselves, with the Trustee facilitating the creation of each contract at the start of a semester. For the contract to be enforced and adhered to, one roommate may go to the Trustee at any time they feel the contract has been breached, and the Trustee can then levy violations on the offending roommate. The third violation of the contract results in a conflict mediation, while the fourth results in a member review. See: later in the manual for sample roommate contract.

### BOARDERS, GUESTS, AND COUCHSURFERS
*Nobody may stay at French House more than 2 weeks without a contract from ICC.*

#### Boarders
Prospective boarders must be approved by a majority house vote. New boarders must pay half of their first month's boarding fees at the beginning of the month. After the first month any payment plan must be decided by the Treasurer. Boarders may pay for access to both the kitchen and house dinners or choose a plan which only allows a choice of meals or kitchen access.

Boarding Costs:  
With Labor      : $105/mo   Kitchen OR Meals, no Labor  : $60  
Without         : $120/mo   Kitchen OR Meals + Labor    : $45

#### Guests
An ICC-contracted member (boarders not included) must be responsible, and will be held liable, for any guest at the house. If any personal propery damage occurs, the guest's sponsor will be held liable and it is their responsibility to replace the property, pay for repairs, or allocate resources to make the situation right in the eyes of the property owner.

Frequent visitors may be voted in as House Friends, which effectively makes the entire house liable for their actions, rather than an individual member. House Friends can know the house code and must be voted in by a house majority at a meeting. House friends will be reviewed on a semesterly basis.

Guests may eat two dinners within a two-week span at the house for free but must pay per meal for additional meals. Guests have kitchen access, but not guff food access.

The house may review liability for specific situations on a case-by-case basis, as this policy may not appropriately apply in certain situations.

#### Couch Surfers
French House accepts Couch surfers under the following strict guidelines:
1. A couch surfer should request a couch with a two-week notice so that they may be approved at a house meeting.

---

2. Maximum of two weeks stay at the house.
3. Couch surfers will not receive the door code.
4. Any member may evict a surfer at any time, at their own discretion
5. Any dissent from any member of the house during a vote process will result in the couch surfer being rejected.

### Kitchen
The kitchen is open 24 hours and food is available to all members unless it is personal food or food which is to be used in the preparation of a meal. If you cook with something or use a dish you MUST clean it. Dishes are not allowed to be stored in the sink. Anyone who puts dishes in the sink, except for dinner clean, is subject to a personal mess fine.

#### Sanitation
Be courteous to toher members and follow all state and city health regulations. Practice cleanliness and do not sit or put your feet on the island or counters.

If anything you use comes in contact with raw meat, you must clean or otherwise replace it with another cutting board/knife/plate, etc. if you plan to use the dish for ANYTHING else.

The Jackson is a sanitizer, not a dishwasher. All items must be cleaned on the tops and bottoms for food remnants, with soap, before being placed in the Jackson.

#### Chef Pots/Bowls/Cutting Boards
Chef pots, bowls, and cutting boards are not to be removed from the kitchen by any member of the house. Pots, cutting boards and bowls (the metal mixing bowls or large plastic bowls) should always remain in the kitchen. Tupperware can be used as an alternative.

#### Dinners
Dinners are served Sunday through Thursday night at 7:00 PM. A veggie option is not guaranteed, but a Kitchen Manager may request cooks accomodate. You may request a save plate if you are not home for dinner, but you must clean it regardless of if you eat the food.

If labor does not allow for five cooks per week, the Labor Czar may cut a meal with consent of the house.

While the chefs of the house are making their food from 5-7:00 PM, the house kitchen should not be used unless you have no other recourse AND the chefs' permission. Similarly, if surfaces are being cleaned, do not take it upon yoursef to prepare a five-course feast and delay the person cleaning. you may cook only with the cleaner's permission. Use proper discretion and politeness when someone is doing their labor - if your duty is to clean the bathroom, you certainly wouldn't appreciate someone using it in the middle of that time.

---

#### Personal Food
All personal food in the fridge, freezer, or shelf must be labeled with the owner's initials and the date the food was placed there. Alcohol does not require initials.

Bagged food will be kept for up to one month after its marked date. Resaurant leftovers will only be left for 1 week. Any food that is rotten or past its expiration date will be thrown out, regardless of the date it was labeled.

Food in the freezer will be moved to the guff freezer if it was labeled in a prior semester. Fridge clean will never throw out new items, but it is the responsibility of the owner of the personal food to accurately label or relabel their items.

#### Save Plates
Anyone requesting a save plate must write their initials in the appropriate box on the whiteboard before dinner is served on the requested day. Save plates will then be protected for 24 hours after the meal and become guff after this period. Failure to eat or otherwise clean your save plate after 48 hours will result in a Personal Mess Fine, though the save plate may be moved to the personal fridge to work around this problem.

Group save plates are not an option and will result in a warning for the cooks the first time, and a labor offense the second time.

### LABOR

####General Policy
Housemates must fulfill 4-5 hours per week of labor requirements to be set by the Labor Czar. Housemates are personally responsible for their labor and in the event that they cannot complete it, should make arrangements to switch labor with another housemate. In the event of a switch, both parties must alert the Labor Czar of a change to their respective labor.

If a house member will have an absence of two weeks or more, they need to alert the Labor Czar at least one week in advance in order to account for labor changes.

If labor spans the entire week, the Labor Czar may ask for additional tidying when labor requires it, to be completed within 24 hours of asking.

#### Labor & Beautification Holiday
Labor Holiday is a mandatory house event wherein the house should be deep cleaned, while Beautification Holiday is a mandatory even wherein new projects, art and remodeling of the house should be the focus. The date of each holiday will be decided by a house vote - Labor Holiday must take place within the first 6 weeks of each semester, and Beautification Holiday should occur at a voted-on time following it.

---

Labor Holiday assignments will be decided by the Labor Czar and announced that morning. Each member will be given a minimum of 4 hours of labor, and their job will be finished when they have worked 4 hours, or their assigned labor is completed - whichever comes last.

Beautification Holiday assignments will be decided on by the house. Beautification holiday is a mandatory event during Fall and Spring semesters wherein each member must complete 2 hours of beautification labor over the course of one weekend. Beautification holiday is voluntary event during Summer session.

If a member is unable to attend Labor or Beautification Holiday, they will be given makeup labor to be made up within a month of the holiday, if makeup labor is not completed there will be a member review. Not alerting the Labor Czar of an absence from the Holiday will result in an automatic member review.

#### Makeup Labor
All missed labor will result in makeup labor to be assigned by the Labor Czar. This labor must be made up in a time determined (within reason) by the Labor Czar. The Labor Czar must keep a hard copy of violations and warnings in addition to the white board.

#### Labor Warning/Fines System
Current Warning/Fine System:  
1st Offense: Warning and makeup labor.  
2nd Offense: Labor violation to be displayed on whiteboard, makeup labor  
3rd Offense: Labor violation to be displayed on whiteboard, makeup labor  
4th Offense: Labor violation to be displayed on whiteboard, house-wide conflict mediation

At the conflict mediation the house will decide the terms for the member-in-question's good standing with the house

#### Party Labor
Any member attending a party for any amount of time will be required to assist in party labor.

Party Labor is to be organized by either the Education Officer, the proposer of a pary, or the Labor Czar. If Party Labor is not organized, the proposer of the party will be responsible for cleanup.  
*See also, Basic House Guidelines: House Parties*

### FINES & PURCHASES

#### House Purchases
Any house purchases above $25 must be approved at a house meeting through a proposal. The Treasurer will issue a check for all approved expenditures. When returning a receipt to the Treasurer, you must write your initials, circle the date, and circle the total before putting it in the wooden box at the base of the stairs.

---

If a housemate loses a receipt, they will be required to pay half of the ICC fine, and will pay the full fine on a second offense. This process begins anew every semester.

#### House Discretionary Funds
Each month funds are given to the house $120 per person, of which 12.5% is meant to be used for discretionary purchases or put towards savings. Any small purchase or house purchase which causes the house to exceed our monthly discretionary fund budget requires a 2/3 vote of quorum.

At the last meeting of every month the treasurer should give a detailed account of spending for the month as well as let the house know what the discretionary funds budge for the next month will be.

#### Small Purchases
If a house member would like to make a small purchase for the betterment of the house, they need two officers to approve said purchase, one of which must be the Treasurer.

If the member proposing the purchase is an officer, they must find two additional officers to approve the purchase. If the member proposing the purchase is the Treasurer, they must get the approval of the Trustee.

#### Personal Mess Fines
A personal mess includes any personal items, leftover dishes or cookware left in common areas for more than 24 hours. Officers may asses a fine of 1 hour of labor which will be assigned by the labor czar. If you notice someone leaves something behind, bring it to his or her attention before alerting an officer. There must be two witnesses in order to issue a personal mess fine. Three personal mess fines will result in a labor violation.

No dishes can sit in the sink. In the event a member places dishes in the sink, personal mess fine can be issued. The only exception to this rule is the use of the sink during Dinner Clean.

#### Maintenance Fines
Performing an act deemed unsafe by the Maintenance Officer, or which puts the house itself at risk can result in makeup labor or a member review. Any "unsafe act" must be mentioned at a meeting. Punishment will be administered in the following manner:

First offense: warning  
Second offense: One hour of labor  
Third offense: Two hours of labor  
Fourth offense: Two hours of labor and conflict mediation  
Fifth offense or more: Member review and if still a member two hours of labor

#### Officer Fines
