# French House Manual
## Fall 2018

---

#### LAST UPDATE: 11-19-2018  
*The French House manual is made to be a set of guidelines - the cooperative living experience is a fluid one which changes from semester to semester. The manual is not the end all be all for house rules - inclusion in the manual doens't mean the house's stance is rigid on a particular topic, while exclusion from the manula doesn't give license to commit any other action.*

### THE SEVEN CO-OPERATIVE PRINCIPLES

#### VOLUNTARY AND OPEN MEMBERSHIP  
Co-operatives are voluntary organizations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.

#### DEMOCRATIC MEMBER CONTROL  
Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner.

#### MEMBER ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION  
Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribesd as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.

#### AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE  
Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.

#### EDUCATION, TRAINING AND INFORMATION  
Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their cooperatives. They inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.

#### CO-OPERATION AMONG CO-OPERATIVES  
Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.

#### CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY  
Co-operatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.
