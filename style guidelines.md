This guide is meant to maintain some consistentcy in the house manual as it is maintained over time by multiple people, sometimes without communication. Most of these rules are here for no other reason and may be changed with little fanfare.

Gender-neutral pronouns should be used unless a gendered pronoun would significantly clarify an idea.  
The house manual should be written in the third-person wherever possible.  
Major section titles should use H2 sized-headers, and minor sections titles should use H3 sized-headers.  
The house manual should use the Oxford comma in all cases.  
Numbers should be written out from zero to nine with numerals for larger values, as in *The Associated Press Stylebook*.  
Slash marks should be surrounded by spaces when used to indicate two different ideas but should be immediately surrounded by numerals when used for a fractional value.
