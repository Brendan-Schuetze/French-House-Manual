This guide is meant to maintain some consistency in the house manual as it is maintained over time by multiple people, sometimes without communication. Most of these rules are here for no other reason and may be changed with little fanfare.

- Gender-neutral pronouns should be used unless a gendered pronoun would significantly clarify an idea.  
- The house manual should be written in the third-person wherever possible.  
- Major section titles should use H2-sized Markdown headers, and minor sections titles should use H3-sized Markdown headers.  
- The house manual should use the Oxford comma in all cases.  
- Numbers should be written out from zero to nine with numerals for larger values, as in *The Associated Press Stylebook*.  
- Monetary values should exclude the cents when the amount of cents is zero  
- Slash marks should not be surrounded by spaces.
- *Italicize* to emphasize. Don't write in all caps.
- "Cooperative" not "co-operative."
- "Couch surfer" should not be capitalized unless occurring at the beginning of a sentence.
- The following words/phrases should be capitalized:
    - "French House"
    - the title of any officer when used to refer to a person (e.g., the Treasurer or the Trustee)
    - the name of any labor when used to refer to a person (e.g., the Fridge Clean)
